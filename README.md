## 📦 Installation

### 1. Download

Click:
**Code → Download ZIP**

Or clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/j0shh3ss/Minecraft-Backup-Manager.git
cd Minecraft-Backup-Manager
```

---

### 2. Run Installer

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:

* Ask for your server location
* Configure all scripts automatically
* Optionally install cron jobs
* Optionally run a test backup

---

## 🧪 Manual Backup

Run anytime:

```bash
./hourly_backup.sh
```

---

## 🔄 Restore a Backup

```bash
./restore.sh
```

Example:

```bash
./restore.sh
Tmux session name [Minecraft]: World
Minecraft server root directory (contains world/, versions/, config/, etc.): [/mnt/server/minecraft]: /mnt/server/minecraft
Path to backup file (.tar.zst): /mnt/server/minecraft/backups/hourly/server_hourly-2026-04-14_09.tar.zst
⚠️ WARNING: This will OVERWRITE your current server files!
Continue? (y/n): y
✅ Restore complete!
```

### What this does:

* Pauses world saving safely
* Replaces your server files with the backup
* Restarts saving

⚠️ **This will overwrite your current server files**

---

### 📌 Important

- The directory you enter must be your **server root folder**
- This is the folder that contains files like:
  - `server.jar`
  - `world/`
  - `plugins/` (if applicable)

Example:

Correct:   /mnt/server/minecraft  
Wrong:     /mnt/server/minecraft/world

## ⏱️ Cron Jobs

If enabled, the installer schedules:

* Hourly → every hour
* Daily → 3:15 AM
* Weekly → Monday 3:30 AM

Edit anytime with:

```bash
crontab -e
```

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```bash

```

---
